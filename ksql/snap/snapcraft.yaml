summary: Streaming SQL interactive client for Apache Kafka
description: |
  This snap installs an interactive KSQL client for development and operations.
  
  Confluent KSQL is the streaming SQL engine that enables real-time data
  processing against Apache KafkaÂ®. It provides an easy-to-use, yet powerful
  interactive SQL interface for stream processing on Kafka, without the need to
  write code in a programming language such as Java or Python. KSQL is scalable,
  elastic, fault-tolerant, and it supports a wide range of streaming operations,
  including data filtering, transformations, aggregations, joins, windowing, and
  sessionization.
